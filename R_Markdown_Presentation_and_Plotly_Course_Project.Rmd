```

## Instructions

### Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(plotly)

p <- plot_ly() %>%
  add_bars(
    x = c("2017", "2018", "2019"),
    y = c(204,187,210),
    base = c(-204,-187,-210),
    marker = list(
      color = 'red'
    ),
    name = 'sales'
  ) %>%
  add_bars(
    x = c("2017", "2018", "2019"),
    y = c(195,190,186),
    base = 0,
    marker = list(
      color = 'blue'
    ),
    name = 'costs'
  )

p
```
